#these are a config files that deployme use like input parameters.

#the variables set in these, can be to changed, depends of the app need.

for example

Is very important, follow the next syntax for create a app.conf file.


   first.


       [name-WebApplication].conf

       Example.

       FillOrderWeb.conf

 NOTE: Most important is having the same name of the application, because this is to use at deployme shell.


Example within the file:

BEA_HOME="/opt/apps/wl10mp3/user_projects/domains/wlsnxt"
WL=wl10
CMP=RenautWeb
TARG="clust02"
USRCFGFILE=/opt/apps/deployme/keys/myuserconfigWLSNXT.secure
KEYFILE=/opt/apps/deployme/keys/myuserkeyWLSNXT.secure
USRCFGFILE2=/opt/apps/deployme/keys/myuserconfigWLSNEXINDE.secure
KEYFILE2=/opt/apps/deployme/keys/myuserkeyWLSNEXINDE.secure
TARG2="adminNexinde"


BEA_HOME is the name path of weblogic
WL=weblogic version
CMP= The name component without .war
USRCFGFILE authuser file to authenticate
KEYFILE keyfile to authenticate




if the WebApp is deployed in two or more different servers, you can have more  USRCFGFILE, KEYFILE and TARG  to need 

  TARG1... TARGn
